<h2>What does this app do?</h2>
<p>The router checks any outgoing call's number with a list of patterns. If there is a match, the router extracts parts from the original phone number, and use a formula to generate a new phone number, then dials this new number instead.</p>
<h2>Why another dialer?</h2>
<p><strong>Better Efficiency</strong>. The router does the match and re-generation for every outgoing call, behind the scene. After the initial setup, you can leave the app and it does the rest for you.</p>
<p><strong>Wider Application</strong>. At the router's core is an algorithm that matches and transforms phone numbers - each digit can be individually matched and re-arranged into a new sequence.</p>
<h2>Definitions:</h2>
<p><strong>Pattern</strong>: specified part(s) to be searched for and extracted from the original number</p>
<p><strong>Formula</strong>: how to generate a new number.</p>
<p><strong>Rule</strong>: The combination of a pattern and a formula. If the pattern matches a phone number, then the formula generates a new number.</p>
<p><strong>Group</strong>: A list of rules. Matching is attempted from top to bottom. The original number is used if there is no match. Multiple groups can be configured, but only one can be in use at a time. A group is likely related to a location or a carrier. i.e. Group "ABB-NY" if you are with carrier ABB and in New York, group "DDC-Shanghai" if you are with carrier DDC in Shanghai.</p>
<p><strong>Gateway</strong>: an intermediate phone number the user calls in order to reach the final destination. e.g. a calling card service provider's local access number.</p>
<p><strong>E.164</strong>: A&nbsp;format for keeping&nbsp;phone numbers. In E.164, a number is hierachical, starts with "+", and typically has&nbsp;country code, area code, and local number. e.g. +1 212 234 5678, +86 21 212121212. A number in E.164 is global in that it does not have to be changed with&nbsp;long distance dialing code.</p>
